### What I learned

As a beginner in the web development world, this challenge really challenged me because i was forced to increase my elasticity that i didn't know existed, some of the things i faced was being able work under the pressure of completing this task within a specified time frame, increased knowledge of some of the HTML and CSS features, my thinking capacity was increased because i had to think of how to style my HTML and much more. So this challenge but a motivation to my web development learning process. This code samples below really helped me in this challenge, they made my work easier.

```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of<div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on areas like responsive design because this is a vital aspect of web development that has been overlooked by some and also focus on pseudo element and classes and hover states for an interactive web page.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc) - This helped me for placing my sections side by side, I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://shaydeecoder.hashnode.dev/responsive-design-strategy) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand rexponsive design. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
